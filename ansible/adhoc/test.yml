# NB: this only works on centos 8 / ohpc v2 as we want UCX
# TODO: add support for groups/partitions
# TODO: add support for combined login/control nodes?
# Prequisites:
# - slurm-libpmi-ohpc package - installed by default by openhpc role

# Use tags like this to run specific tests:
#   ansible-playbook ansible/adhoc/test.yml --tags pingmatrix
#
# Only works for default partition. If this isn't the entire set of compute nodes you must also set
# `openhpc_tests_nodes` to relevant nodes using a slurm node expression expression, e.g.:
#   ansible-playbook ansible/adhoc/test.yml --tags pingmatrix openhpc_tests_nodes=mycluster-hpc-[0-3]
